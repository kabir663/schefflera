    <p>The Queensland Umbrella Tree (<i>Schefflera actinophylla</i>) is a striking evergreen tree known for its glossy, palmate leaves that resemble the spokes of an umbrella. Native to the tropical rainforests of Australia, it can grow up to 15 meters in height and thrives in warm, humid climates. The tree is celebrated for its vibrant red flower spikes that bloom during summer, attracting birds and pollinators.</p>
    <p>This versatile tree is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value, providing shade and aesthetic appeal. However, in some regions, it is considered invasive due to its aggressive growth and seed dispersion. Despite this, its cultural significance and ability to adapt to urban environments make it a favorite in tropical gardens.</p>
